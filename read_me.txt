Link to run locally on the computer: http://127.0.0.1:5001
If we want to run locally but use a different device, it needs to be connected to the same wifi and change the link to:  http://IP_NUMBER_OF_WIFI:5001
In "IP_NUMBER_OF_WIFI" it should be the IP of the wifi that the computer is connected to, and we can see that by going to the preferences of the browser.
